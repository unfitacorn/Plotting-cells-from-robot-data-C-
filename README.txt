This is my submission for CS22510.


The files that should be here are (excluding this text file):

-screencast.avi

-CS225 Assignment 1 documentation

-C++ Assignment 1 (FOLDER)
	-CMakeLists.txt
	-data.cpp
	-data.h
	-graphHandler.cpp
	-graphHandler.h
	-main.cpp
	-"poses.txt" (this is how it reads in)
	-"ranges.txt" (this is how it reads in)

The poses and ranges need to be in the working directory as the whereabouts are hardcoded and it doesn't 
give the option to change.

The CMakeLists.txt was generated by the IDE I used (CLion). This is used to help generate the make file.

The data class creates the objects that contain all the information read in from the poses and ranges files.

The graphhandler.cpp/.h contain all the code that works on the creation and editing of the graph/cells.

The main.cpp calls all of the functions in the correct order. It also reads in the data from the files.

Using C++11.
The CMake version minimum is "cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2)" 

All packages:

#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fstream>

HOW TO RUN CODE IN TERMINAL (ANY PROBLEMS PLEASE REFER TO SCREENCAST WITH VISUAL STEPS):

1.direct to directory using "cd"
2.type "cmake ."
3.type "make"
4.type "./C___Assignment_1"
